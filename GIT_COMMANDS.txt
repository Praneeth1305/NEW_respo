Branching in Git
========================
This is a feature of git using which we can create seperate branches
for different functionalites and later merge them with the main branch
also known as the master branch.This will help in creating the code in
an uncluttered way

1 To see the list of local branches
  git branch

2 To see the list all branches local and remote
  git branch -a

3 To create a branch
  git branch branch_name

4 To move into a branch
  git checkout branch_name

5 To create a branch and also move into it
  git checkout -b branch_name

6 To merge a branch
  git merge branch_name

7 To delete a branch that is merged
  git branch -d branch_name 
  This is also called as soft delete

8 To delete a branch that is not merged
  git branch -D branch_name
  This is also known as hard delete

============================================================================
Note: Whenever a branch is create whatever is the commit history of the 
parent branch will be copied into the new branch

Note: Irrespective of, on which branch a file is created or modified git only
considers form which branch it is commited and the file belongs to that
commited branch only.
